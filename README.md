Developing eCoffee was culminating all that I have learned from my online learning and then some. Building an eCommerce platform seemed pretty standard and straight-forward, so adding functionality that would qualify eCoffee as a Blog as well was a must.

I started from the Backend and worked my way to the Frontend, making use of Postman to ensure my Routing was working as intended and I was communicating with my MongoDB database. I find working from Backend to Frontend is a more enjoyable workflow, because then you just have to <i>hook up</i> clicks and buttons to things. These "things" being the Actions for my Redux Reducers. Redux is definitely a tool I like a lot, it makes State Management very digestable and rather simple.

The most challenging part of this project was probably devising the Admin Panel with means to sort Consumer Orders by the Date they placed them or if they were Paid or Delivered yet. Beyond that, the scope of the project, chipping away at it day-by-day, because ultimately it was putting into practice all that I had been studying till that point, so I had plenty of notes to guide me along the way as well as example code from previous projects. React Quill was a bit of a nuisance to get working as well, but that is about it!
